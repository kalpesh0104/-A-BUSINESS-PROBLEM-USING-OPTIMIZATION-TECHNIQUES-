"Decsription":

Imagine a company has 3 factories that make products and 4 warehouses that need those products. Each route from a factory to a warehouse costs money. The company wants to **deliver products in the cheapest way possible**, without running out at the factories and making sure each warehouse gets what it needs. Using Python and PuLP, we told the computer:"Figure out the best way to send products to save money."The computer calculated and gave the perfect shipping plan that **meets all needs** and **keeps costs low** â€” just like how a smart manager would plan deliveries!
